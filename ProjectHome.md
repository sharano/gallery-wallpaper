This is a live wallpaper for Android that uses the gallery to grab images; it can restrict itself to one or more folders, or even specific images.

The wallpaper can display pictures of any size or aspect ratio: by making use of the ability to slide between home screens, the graphics can fill the screen without cropping the image.

## Project goals ##
  * minimum processor usage to preserve battery life as much as possible
  * flexibility to handle any number of home screens, arranged in a row, column, or grid.
  * support for Android versions 2.1 to 4.0 and up
  * Ability for lots of customization, potentially including new sources for pictures
